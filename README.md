## Introduction

This project simulates a private Eventbrite-like application where:

- Users can create events.
- Users can attend multiple events.
- Events can be attended by many users.
- Events take place at a specific date and location.

The project emphasizes **ActiveRecord associations**, **foreign keys**, and **class name management** in Rails.

---

## Features

- User authentication with [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise).  
- Create, view, and manage events.  
- Attend events via a many-to-many relationship.  
- Display past and upcoming events separately.  
- Event details show attendees.  
- User profile pages list created and attended events.
